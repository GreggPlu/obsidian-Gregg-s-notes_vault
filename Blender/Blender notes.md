To change the units, select Scene from the right toolbar. Then pick Units.

You can display multiple versions of an object using the Array modifier. This is still only a single object but appears as various objects in an array.

You can manipulate a group of objects by assigning an object as a child to another. This makes a parent/child relationship between the objects. When you transform the parent, the changes are applied to the child. However, if you transform the child, those changes are not applied to the parent. A parent can have multiple children. A child can have a child (nested). To manipulate a group of objects without creating parent/child relations. You can add an empty object, make that the parent, then make the empty object the parent to all the objects in the group. When you transform the empty object parent, those changes are applied to its children.

When using the loop cut tool, use Ctrl R and use the mouse wheel to increase the number of loops. If you only pick on the loop cut tool icon, instead of the keyboard shortcut, it won't let you increase the number of loops. In that case rolling the mouse wheel zooms in or out.
